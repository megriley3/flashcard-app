# flashcard-app
react assessment

This is an application for a capstone that allows a user to create, edit, and delete decks of flashcards to study. The app allows the user to study each flashcard by selecting deck and then flipping through the cards.

To make this application, I needed to research Bootstrap library and some questions I had about memory leaks.

This application can be used by students or teachers wanting an interactive and easy way to make digital flashcards.

I used React, React Hooks, NPM packages, node.js, and JSX to create this app.
